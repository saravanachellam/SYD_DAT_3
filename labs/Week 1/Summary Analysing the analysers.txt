 
1)Improper job descriptions and organisation defintion of data scientists.

2)Clustering data scientist based on survey results

3)Classification of data scientist - data business,data creative,data researcher and data developer .


4)T - shaped Data scientist -

Be strong in one area (statistics,visualisation),but also have broad & relativelu uniform skills across other areas(big data,Machine learning ,business).

So that colloboration is easier .


5) Took survey to indentify my type of data scientist - Data creative.

It gives more clarity based on what a person wants in the field of data science.
