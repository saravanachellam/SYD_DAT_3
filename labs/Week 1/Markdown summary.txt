+   Data sceience is a team sport and people constantly collaborate 

+   Besides the usual skills, the other thing that’s really
    important is the ability to make, storytell, and create narratives. 
    Also, never losing the feeling of passion and curiosity.

+   maximizing your exposure to different
    opportunities.

+  DataGotham is our attempt to highlight this diversity. We started it as a public flag that
   we planted and said, “Whatever you do, if you care about data, come here and meet other
   people who also feel the same way.”

+ More flexibility in working when working in startups.Easily avaible data sets.


+ For each data project you’re working on, you need to ask yourself these questions: what
  are you working on? How will I know when it’s done? What does it impact? 

+  Dividing the work of a data scientist into three buckets: Stats, Code, and Storytelling/Visualization.
   Whichever one of those you’re best at, do a project that highlights that strength. Then, do a project
   using whichever one of those you’re worst at. This helps you grow, learn something new,
   and figure out what you need to learn next. Keep going from there.
